# TINU
TINU, the open tool to create bootable macOS installers 

[TINU Is Not Unibe**t]

This software is intended to be used to create a bootable macOS installer for computers capable of running Apple's macOS, this app is basically a GUI for the createinstallmedia executable that could be found in any macOS installer app from Mavericks up to the latest versions.

Allows you to create easily a macOS install media without messing around with command line stuff and without using disk utility, and also detects and prevents the most common errors with the creation of bootable vanilla macOS installers. 

# For the latest Source code check out the delopment branch!

# Features:
- Simple-to-use UI that allows you to easily start the bootable macOS installer creation process.
- Support for multiple languages (currently just italian, but more will be added with future updates once the system which allows it gets improoved)
- It can work with every macOS installer app that has the createinstallmedia executable inside its resources folder (including also beta and newly released installers).
- You can use any erasable volume that is at least 7 GB of size (if the volume's drive is not in GUID format, TINU will re-format it accordingly).
- Can work with the Mac OS recovery system, so you can create a bootable macOS installer from the macOS installer itself or from the macOS recovery partition, and you can use TINU to install macOS, too.
- 100% clean: The bootable macOS installers created with this tool are vanilla, just as if you created them using the command line "createinstallmedia" method in Terminal.
- Open Source: You can verify what this program does on your computer and you can create your own version by downloading and playing with the source code.
- Does not require any special preparations. Just open the program, make sure you have a USB drive plugged in and have a macOS installer app on your disk.
- No need to use Disk Utility. TINU can format your drive or partition for you.
- Integrated EFI partition mounter tool.
- Works using the latest versions of macOS and will also support newer Mac installers out of the box without requiring an update.
- Offers features to customize your bootable macOS installer.
