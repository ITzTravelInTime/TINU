# TINU

TINU is the open tool to create bootable macOS installers.

[TINU Is Not Unibe**t]

This software is intended to be used to create a bootable macOS installer for computers capable of running Apple's macOS. This app, among other things, is also a GUI for the createinstallmedia executable that could be found in any macOS installer app from Mavericks up to the latest versions.

It allows you to easily create a macOS install media without messing around with command line stuff and without using Disk Utility, and also detects and prevents the most common errors with the creation of bootable vanilla macOS installers.

# For the latest Source code check out the development branch!

# Features:
- No need for guides or instructions! Just follow the very simple on-screen indications to very easily start the bootable macOS installer creation process.
- Fully open: You can see how this program works and you can freely contribute to it! (See the `Repository rules` and the `Note that` sections of this page)
- Support for multiple languages (currently just Italian and English, but more will be added with future updates once the system which allows it gets improved)
- Can work with every macOS installer app that has the `createinstallmedia` executable inside its internal resources folder (including also beta and newly released installers).
- 100% clean using the official apple's method: The bootable macOS installers created with this tool are made using the official apple's `createinstallmedia` method, just as if you created them using the command line, this ensures the best and the cleanest results avoiding all the problems that modded installers have.
- Does not require any special preparations. Just open the program, make sure you have a big enough USB drive plugged in (see the `Requirements` section) and have a macOS installer app on your disk.
- No need to use Disk Utility first. TINU can format your drive or partition for you, if it's necessary.
- Integrated downloads from Apple for lots of macOS/OS X installer apps (to access them open the app, go to the menu bar, and then `Tools->Download a macOS installer`).
- Integrated EFI partition mounter tool.
- Automatic Clover and OpenCore EFI folder installer.
- Tested to work on all the latest macOS releases.
- Makes use of the latest Swift 5 language and the latest Xcode release.

 (To suggest a new feature please contact us.)

# Requirements:
- A computer that runs Mac OS X Yosemite or a more recent version (Mac OS X El Capitan is required to use TINU inside a macOS Recovery/Installer OS).
- A drive or a free partition of least 8 GB (9+ for Catalina, 12+ for Big Sur and newer versions) that you want to turn into a macOS/Mac OS X installer (NOTE: partitions are usable only if they belong to a drive which uses the GUID partition format).
- A copy of a macOS/Mac OS X installer app (Mavericks or newer versions are supported), it's recommended to have the app placed into the /Applications folder or in the root of a volume connected to your computer (excepted the drive/volume you want to turn into your macOS install media).
