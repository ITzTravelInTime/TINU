-keep usb drive name options

-drive name constant while installing (maybe put a "(renamed to ... )" messange)

-drive removable detection function in dm

-standardized drive icon function



*/

/*TODO but with less priority:

-reimplement efi partition mounter's back end using codable classes (Work in progress)

-download installer app window resizable
-installer app download background dark in dark mode

-write translation guidelines and how to translate to a new language

-fix crash recovery mode sudo manager
-fix volumes detection in recovery

-it's better to no longer mention directly hackintosh and hackintoshing in the tool, since it can be couse of possible problems maybe?

-show license just once as a dialog-ish window on the first usage of the app, maybe it's better just to have a disclamener rather than the license, since that is related to the distribution of the app

-optimize efi partition mounter for menu usage (not a lot of priority)

-touch id efi partition mounter (big maybe)

-show all mounted volumes in the drive detection but don't make them usable if they can't be used, and show a no go sign like with installer apps

-send notitifcation if the tinu version is not up to date (use a json file containing the reference link and the reference information to get)

-initial screen more like a home menu with more features ready to use + help section in this new home screen (which in cludes con tact us and help info and faqs)

-find a way to have the drive icon choosen accordignly to the disk type, maybe detecting is it's internal or not

-dynamic contact us window using the text assets or a json file (maybe the second option is the better one)

-take the user to contact us in case of problems

-global error screen for the installer creation/installation
