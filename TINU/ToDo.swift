/*TODO:

-continue with ui revision

-reimplement efi partition mounter's back end using codable classes

-fix sudo at startup on catalina
-diagnostics mode prompt for sip off with remember choiche
maybe put the diagnostics mode file in the ~/Library/ApplicationSupport Folder as a solution

-rewrite options descriptions

-download installer app window resizable
-download installer app sections like in the efi mounter
-installer app download background dark 

*/

/*TODO but with less priority:

-put all the important ui strings into the textmanager json file

-fix crash recovery mode sudo manager
-fix volumes detection in recovery

-notifications texts handled by textmanager

-it's better to no longer mention directly hackintosh and hackintoshing in the tool, since it can be couse of possible problems maybe?

-show license just once as a dialog-ish window on the first usage of the app, maybe it's better just to have a disclamener rather than the license
-not always prompt for mackie100 tools into the efi partition mounter

-optimize efi partition mounter for menu usage

-touch id efi partition mounter

-show all mounted volumes in the drive detection but don't make them usable if they can't be used

-send notitifcation if the tinu version is not up to date (use a plist file containing the reference link and the reference information to get)

-initial screen more like a home menu with more features ready to use + help section in this new home screen (which in cludes con tact us and help info and faqs)

-find a way to have the drive icon accordignly to the disk type
