/*TODO:

-add unusable catalina and newer app if the usb driver is less than 9 gb
-add time machine detection for disks
-continue with ui revision

-reimplement efi partition mounter's back end using codable classes

-fix sudo at startup on catalina

*/

/*TODO but with less priority:

-it's better to no longer mention directly hackintosh and hackintoshing in the tool, since it can be couse of possible problems maybe?

-download installer app window resizable
-download installer app sewctions like in the efi mounter

-show license just once as a dialog-ish window on the first usage of the app
-not always prompt for mackie100 tools into the efi partition mounter

-optimize efi partition mounter for menu usage

-touch id efi partition mounter
