/*TODO:

-continue with ui revision

-copyright string localization

-EFI PM memory leak

-divide language files in folders one for each language rather than re-naming them according to the language to use

-debug and test all of the features

-remove partitions unmount hardcode (detect the partitions to unmount)

-install clover and open core efi folder label fix

-adopt sf symbols icons when possible

-menu items text from json

-credits view controller text from json (probably requires a custom json)

-contacts view controller text from json (probably requires a cutom json)

-macOS installer version icons as .icns

*/

/*TODO but with less priority:

-right to left languages ui support
-installation unsupported apps (lion and mountain lion) mark instead of hiding

-reimplement efi partition mounter's back end using codable classes (Work in progress)

-download installer app window resizable
-installer app download background dark in dark mode

-write translation guidelines and how to translate to a new language

-fix crash recovery mode sudo manager
-fix volumes detection in recovery

-it's better to no longer mention directly hackintosh and hackintoshing in the tool, since it can be couse of possible problems maybe?

-show license just once as a dialog-ish window on the first usage of the app, maybe it's better just to have a disclamener rather than the license, since that is related to the distribution of the app

-optimize efi partition mounter for menu usage (not a lot of priority)

-show all mounted volumes in the drive detection but don't make them usable if they can't be used, and show a no go sign like with installer apps

-send notitifcation if the tinu version is not up to date (use a json file containing the reference link and the reference information to get)

-initial screen more like a home menu with more features ready to use + help section in this new home screen (which in cludes con tact us and help info and faqs)

-dynamic contact us window using the text assets or a json file (maybe the second option is the better one)

-take the user to contact us in case of problems

-global error screen for the installer creation/installation
